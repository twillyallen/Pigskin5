    <h1>About Pigskin5</h1>

    <p>
      Pigskin5 is a free daily NFL trivia game: <strong>5 questions</strong>, <strong>15 seconds per question</strong>,
      and a daily leaderboard that rewards both <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>speed</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Runs Pigskin5</h2>
    <p>
      Pigskin5 is independently created and operated by <strong>Thomas Allen</strong> (also known online as <strong>Twillyallen</strong>).
      I built Pigskin5 as a passion project to practice Web Development and combine it with my lifelong love of NFL football, and I’m committed to keeping it
      accurate, fun, and improving over time.
