    <h1>About Pigskin5</h1>

    <p>
      Pigskin5 is a free daily NFL trivia game: <strong>5 questions</strong>, <strong>15 seconds each</strong>,
      and a daily leaderboard that rewards both <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>speed</strong>.
      New quiz every day. No account needed. Just football.
    </p>

    <h2>The Story Behind It</h2>
    <p>
      I'm <strong>Thomas Allen</strong>. I'm a lifelong NFL fan and web developer based in the US.
      I've been obsessed with football for as long as I can remember. As a recent Computer Science Grad, I wanted
      to keep practicing and testing my skills, so I made a fun little trivia game for my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I write every question myself, I push updates in my spare
      time, and I play the quiz every single day, sometimes embarrassingly early in the morning.
      The goal has always been to build the NFL trivia game I wished already existed: fast, fair,
      competitive, and genuinely fun for fans who actually know their football.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find me online as <strong>Twillyallen</strong>. If you've got feedback, a correction,
      or just want to talk football, I genuinely want to hear from you... 
      Reach me at <strong>pigskin5game@gmail.com</strong> or through the <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.

    <h2>How Pigskin5 Works</h2>
    <p>
      Every day at midnight, a new quiz goes live. Every player gets the same five questions.
      You've got 15 seconds per question, and your score is based on both how many you get right and
      how fast you answer. Get them all right and you're in the running for the top of the leaderboard.
      Miss one and, well, there's always tomorrow.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>One quiz per day.</strong> Same for everyone, keeps the leaderboard fair.</li>
      <li><strong>5 questions</strong>, each with a <strong>15-second</strong> timer.</li>
      <li><strong>Points reward speed + accuracy.</strong> Quick correct answers score higher.</li>
      <li><strong>Leaderboard is optional.</strong> Play just for yourself if you prefer.</li>
      <li><strong>No login required.</strong> Open the site and start playing instantly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Question Topics</h2>
    <p>
      Questions rotate across the full spectrum of NFL knowledge:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NFL History:</strong> iconic moments, legendary players, records, and throwbacks</li>
      <li><strong>Current Season:</strong> recent games, storylines, and relevant stats</li>
      <li><strong>Player Knowledge:</strong> careers, team changes, awards, and memorable plays</li>
      <li><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> surprising trivia and weird-but-true NFL details</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Streak Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Pigskin5 tracks two streaks for you locally in your browser. No account needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily Streak:</strong> how many days in a row you've played</li>
      <li><strong>Touchdown Streak:</strong> how many perfect 5/5 games in a row you've scored</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Streaks are stored in your browser's local storage, so they stay private and don't require
      any kind of sign-in.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy & Quality</h2>
    <p>
      I take getting the answers right seriously. Every question is researched before it goes live,
      and if a mistake slips through... which it happens... I want to fix it fast. If you spot something
      wrong, please <a href="contact.html">let me know</a>. Corrections are always welcome.
    </p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How do I play?</h3>
    <p>
      Hit "Start" on the homepage to begin today's quiz. Answer 5 multiple-choice questions before
      the timer runs out. After finishing you'll see your score, a question review, and the option
      to submit your name to the daily leaderboard.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I play more than once per day?</h3>
    <p>
      Nope! One quiz per day per player. This keeps the leaderboard fair and the daily challenge
      meaningful. Come back tomorrow for a fresh set of questions.
    </p>

    <h3>Does Pigskin5 collect my personal data?</h3>
    <p>
      Pigskin5 doesn't require accounts. Your streaks and results are stored locally in your browser
      and never sent anywhere. If you choose to submit a leaderboard score, only your display name,
      score, and answer timing are recorded. Read the full <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.
    </p>

    <h3>Is Pigskin5 affiliated with the NFL?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Pigskin5 is an independent, fan-made project. It is not endorsed by or affiliated with
      the NFL, any NFL team, or any official football organization. All NFL-related trademarks and
      intellectual property belong to their respective owners.
    </p>

    <h3>How is the leaderboard scored?</h3>
    <p>
      Points are awarded for correct answers, with faster answers earning more points. If two players
      get the same number correct, speed acts as the tiebreaker. The leaderboard resets daily.
    </p>

    <h2>Support the Project</h2>
    <p>
      Pigskin5 is completely free to play and always will be. Hosting and development costs are
      covered through advertising, so if you're willing to allow ads, it genuinely helps keep the
      game alive and improving. I appreciate every single player who shows up daily. Thank you.
