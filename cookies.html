    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: December 28, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work more efficiently and to provide reporting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Pigskin 5) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics).
    </p>

    <h2>Why We Use Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Site to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Site. Third parties serve cookies through our Site for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

    <h2>How to Control Cookies</h2>

    <h3>Browser Settings</h3>
    <p>
      Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, limiting cookies may impact your experience on our Site and prevent certain features from functioning properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's how to manage cookies in common browsers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chrome:</strong> Settings → Privacy and Security → Cookies and other site data</li>
      <li><strong>Firefox:</strong> Settings → Privacy & Security → Cookies and Site Data</li>
      <li><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences → Privacy → Cookies and website data</li>
      <li><strong>Edge:</strong> Settings → Cookies and site permissions → Cookies and site data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Opt Out of Personalized Advertising</h3>
    <p>
      You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Settings</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Page</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Online Choices (EU)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not mean you will stop seeing ads. You will still see the same number of advertisements, but they may be less relevant to your interests.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile Device Settings</h3>
    <p>
      Mobile devices also have settings to control advertising tracking:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → Privacy → Tracking (toggle "Allow Apps to Request to Track")</li>
      <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
    <p>
      Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites that you do not want your online activities tracked. Our Site does not currently respond to DNT signals because there is no industry standard for how DNT signals should be interpreted.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookie Duration</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies may be "session" cookies or "persistent" cookies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Session cookies:</strong> Temporary cookies that are deleted when you close your browser</li>
      <li><strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> Remain on your device until they expire or you delete them through browser settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The duration of each cookie varies depending on its purpose. Essential cookies typically last for the duration of your browsing session or until the next day's quiz. Advertising cookies may last from several months to a few years.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our cookie practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy indicates when it was most recently revised.
    </p>
